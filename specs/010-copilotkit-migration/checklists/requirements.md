# Specification Quality Checklist: CopilotKit Agent Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec references some technical terms (LangGraph, CopilotKit, Qdrant, MCP) but these are product/service names essential to understanding the feature scope, not implementation decisions.
- RAG database confirmed as Qdrant Cloud based on codebase analysis (QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY, QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME env vars found in vector-storage-service.ts).
